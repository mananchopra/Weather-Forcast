# Weather-Forcast

#Prerequisites

An openweathermap API key.


#Project Structure

I have used Node.js for backend and HTML 5, CSS and Java Script for front end for this project. This is a cool weather forcast app which shows you current weather temprature of your location and gives you details of maximum and minimum temprature of whole day. It also gives you information about humidity and air pressure currently present in atmosphere.


#Working on Improvements

The application now only reports the current weather. It should probably report the forecast e.g. a few hours from now. 

The app currently reports the weather only for location defined in the backend. Shouldn't it check the browser location and use that as the reference for making a forecast?
